    <h3>Easy Bacon and Cheese Quiche</h3>
    <p>This is an <strong>easy</strong>, <strong>delicious</strong> quiche that takes no time to prepare using a frozen deep-dish pie crust, bacon bits, cream, and two types of cheese. I have made this for numerous brunches and everyone raves about it!</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (9 inch) deep dish frozen pie crust</li>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) can bacon bits</li>
        <li>Â½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>5 ounces shredded Swiss cheese</li>
        <li>3 ounces grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>4 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup half-and-half cream/li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place unthawed pie crust in a pie pan on a baking sheet. Mix bacon, chopped onion, and both cheeses in a medium bowl. Pour this mixture into the crust.</li>
        <li>Mix eggs and half and half in a bowl until blended; pour the egg mixture over the cheese mixture. </li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until the top of the quiche begins to turn golden brown, an additional 35 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
